Together we also implemented Figma to a higher degree in the company’s workflow, which has made the clients feel more involved and at ease, and internally solved several communicational challenges and mistakes in general. Being at Bærnholdt has made me ready for more responsibility and engaging challenges, motivating and fueling my ambition and passion.",

I was really impressed with Mortens ability to hit the mark with very little information and his ability to dish out great designs in ludacris speeds...<br/><br/> Morten has also been the main driver on building the identity for our partner universes called Connect and Publish - both have received very positive feedback from partners and business developers.<br/><br/> If your looking for a great designer who can deliver quality designs and concepts in no time, but still with the users experience and interests at heart, you should reach out to Morten. He has my highest recommendations."</>

He has a genuine interest in design and he appreciates to challenge Fintech decision makers to be innovative and forward-looking. <br/><br/> Besides his obvious design skills, Morten is a funny and an all-around great colleague with a stable work attitude. His dismissal from Firstborn Capital is solely a result of a strategic cooperation with external resources. <br/><br/> I truly wish Morten good luck in the future and would highly recommend him."</>

        recom_cont: <>For the past half year, I have worked intensively together with Morten on various projects including the new redesign for Huset Markedsføring - Dansk Markedsføring. This project had a high degree of complexity and was a huge site, where several areas within structure, processes and flows had to be rethought from the bottom - membership flow, payment, newsletters with more. <br/><br/> Morten fearlessly approached the assignment - as a result ended up with him taking over the entire design process from one of our Senior Digital Designers, because we felt the case were in safe and good hands. His outputs are on a high level that you often forget that he is not a senior designer. Always with inputs and design considerations that you only expect from more heavy qualified designers. <br/><br/> Morten is the kind of person that always stays updated on the newest opportunities within technology and the latest shifting trends, which provides him with an extra force in contributing with great concepts and ideas in regards to new requirements and procedures. Morten also understands Frontend development which provides him with an advantage when he designs, that he is constantly thinking in terms of how it should be coded or implemented. Additionally Morten was a socially engaged employee who greatly contributed to the culture of the place. Always with a positive attitude to work and colleagues. He has been a big asset to the design department and the company in general. <br/><br/> It has been a pleasure to work with Morten, and I hope I get the opportunity to work with him again someday.</>
